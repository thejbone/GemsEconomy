# GemsEconomy

Modified version of GemsEconomy
Spigot link: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/gemseconomy.19655/

This version has an updated code base forked from Gadsee/GemsEconomy.

### My changes:
- Added a default economy entry to the config (via the Economy singular/plural name). 
  - This is for per server default economies. 
- Removed the default economy option within each currency type
- Updated balance for singular/multiple to support more formatting options.
